    <title>License Plate Number Recognition in Harsh Weather Conditions</title>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The problem we decided to solve is license plate number recognition in harsh weather conditions. Now this problem has obviously been solved, so to make it our own we wanted to see if we could detect license plate numbers within difficult weather conditions, specifically snow. Detecting license plate numbers can have many real world applications such as highway ticketing as cameras can easily send bills to houses where the license plate is registered. However, what if it is a rainy or snowy day, will the license plate have difficulty being read? This problem is twofold in terms of machine learning as we first needed to detect a license plate on a car using the pre-trained object detection model Yolov8. Then in order to actually read the plate we had to use a text recognition model called Easyocr. So to summarize this we relied on two models Yolov8 and Easyocr.</p>
