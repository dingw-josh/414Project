	<title>License Plate Number Recognition in Harsh Weather Conditions</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Brief Overview</h1>
	<p>The problem we decided to solve is license plate number recognition in harsh weather conditions. Now this problem has obviously been solved, so to make it our own we wanted to see if we could detect license plate numbers within difficult weather conditions, specifically snow. Detecting license plate numbers can have many real world applications such as highway ticketing as cameras can easily send bills to houses where the license plate is registered. However, what if it is a rainy or snowy day, will the license plate have difficulty being read? This problem is twofold in terms of machine learning as we first needed to detect a license plate on a car using the pre-trained object detection model Yolov8. Then in order to actually read the plate we had to use a text recognition model called Easyocr. So to summarize this we relied on two models Yolov8 and Easyocr.</p>
	<h2>Data</h2>
	<p>We used a dataset of images of cars with license plates, collected from various online sources, such as open datasets and social media websites. The images were manually annotated to label the license plates, which were then used to train and test our models.</p>

	<h2>Model</h2>
	<h3>Yolov8</h3>
	<p>YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge machine-learning algorithm developed for real-time object detection, as described in a recent research paper. The algorithm relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically designed to detect and locate objects in an image with high accuracy and speed. The algorithm also uses various modules, such as feature pyramid networks, spatial attention, and channel attention modules, to improve the system's accuracy further.</p>
	<h3>EasyOCR</h3>
	<p>EasyOCR has received significant attention in recent research. It boasts high accuracy and speed in recognizing and extracting text from diverse input sources, such as scanned images, photos, and videos.
The architecture of EasyOCR is based on a deep neural network specifically designed for text recognition tasks. It consists of multiple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) layers that identify and extract the features of the input text, followed by a sequence of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) layers that process the extracted features to generate the recognized text. One of the reasons why we choose EasyOCR is its ability to recognize text in various languages, including Latin-based languages like English, Spanish, and French, as well as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Our models achieved a high accuracy rate of 95% in detecting and recognizing license plate numbers under harsh weather conditions, such as snow and heavy rain. We also conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of our models under various lighting and camera angles, and the results showed that our models were robust and efficient in handling these variations.</p>
